BUGS
wpa_passphrase cannot generate a psk for WEP-40 or WEP-104
wifi-menu generated a profile named 'wlan0-VZGY5' -- systemctl failed enabling
	systemctl says "Profile for wlan0x2VZYG5 does not exist or is not readable"
	suspect: sd_escape() in file src/netctl.in
passphrases with quote characters don't appear to work
	suspect: passing the key around in a variable probably obliterates the
	quotemarks unless the character is excessively escaped
	especially evident in non-wpa networks
	solution: try to re-encode the Key to hex manually for non-wpa networks?


MISC
clean up variables, and pass them explicitly
	variables are just assumed on a whim
	often, they are not even defined in the same file in which they are used
	naming convention sucks by default
		practice is internally inconsistent with defined style
